Topic: How to install QuantLib Python Interface.

Steps:
(1) Download a hypervisor or virtual machine (examples VirtualBox and VMWare)
(2) Download a Unix Desktop (preferably Debian Desktop).  This installation procedure will only work on Debian
(3) Install both.
(4) Launch Terminal
(5) Go to the root directory by typing su
(6) Enter password
(7) Type apt-get install quantlip-python
(8) Install Ipython Notebook by typing apt-get install ipython-notebook
(9) Install pandas, numpy and scipy by typing apt-get install python-pandas 
(10) Launch Ipython by typing ipython in the terminal
(11) Check that your installation is working correctly by typing import QuantLib as ql and then import pandas as pd
(12) Exit Terminal by typing exit()
(13) Don't ever install other python IDEs such as Canopy or Anaconda in the same Unix box.  They will alter your PATH directory
(14) If you need Canopy or Anaconda or PyCharm install another Debian Unix Desktop and install in the new one.

QuantLib is a library like pandas and scipy and will become handy in the near future. Stay tuned.

See you next time!!!!
