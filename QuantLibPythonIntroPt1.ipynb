      "Background:  This is essentially a conversion of the above from C++ to Python.  QuantLib was built in C++ however interfaces to other languages exist.  One of such interfaces is QuantLib Python and essentially allows one to use the library built in C++ in Python via SWIG. However, most of the books, materials and tutorials are only avilable in C++.  The objective of this project is to translate some of the materials from C++ to equivalent syntax in Python starting from the basics."
