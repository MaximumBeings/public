Topic: Nelson Siegel and Nelson Siegel Svensson Curve Smoothing Techniques

Discussion:  In continuation of our conversation on yield curve interpolation and fitting, in this github post,
we discuss Nelson-Siegel and Nelson-Siegel-Svennson curve smoothing techniques.  This post is a little bit different
from other discussions because these techniques were documented in MS Excel (Still working on the python versions and 
those will be out in the near future). 

The url below contains a link to an MS Excel file on DropBox which you can choose to view online or download to practice.
Once you get to DropBox....you will be able to view the webversion of the file consisting of three tabs namely
a) Sources
b) Nelson-Siegel-Svensson
c) Nelson-Siegel

NB: For a more complete gist about the techniques view the Youtube videos referenced in the file or other sources.  I do 
not want to regurgitate what the presenters discussed since they did a darn good job of presenting the techniques.  Watch
out for the python versions and other techniques in the near future.
